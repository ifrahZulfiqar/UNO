# UNO Game using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This project is a Java implementation of the popular card game UNO. It utilizes Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to manage the game logic efficiently. Players can enter the number of users who want to play, receive their cards, and play the game. If a player cannot play a card on their turn, they must draw a new card. The game continues until one of the players finishes all their cards, declaring them the winner.

## Features

- **Player Management**: Enter the number of players who want to play the game.
  
- **Card Distribution**: Distribute cards to each player at the start of the game.
  
- **Gameplay**: Players take turns playing cards. If a player cannot play a card, they draw a new card.
  
- **Winning Condition**: The game continues until one of the players finishes all their cards, declaring them the winner.

## How to Play

1. **Player Setup**: Enter the number of players who want to play the game.
   
2. **Card Distribution**: Each player receives a set of cards at the beginning of the game.
   
3. **Gameplay**: Players take turns playing cards according to the game rules. If a player cannot play a card, they draw a new card.
   
4. **Winning**: The game continues until one player finishes all their cards. The player who finishes all their cards first wins the game.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language used for development.
  
- **Data Structures**: Utilized for efficient management of player cards and game state.
